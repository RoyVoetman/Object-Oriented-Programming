A Facade => Simplifies the interface of a set of classes
B Observer => Allows objects to be notified when a specific object changes
C Composite => Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects in the same way
D State => Encapsulate varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state and uses delegation to switch between behavior
E Template method => Subclasses decide how to implement steps in an algorithm
F Decorator => Wraps an object to provide new behavior
G Command => Encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time
H Strategy => Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable
I Iterator => Provides a wat to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation
J Proxy => Wraps an object to control access to it
K Adapter => Wraps an object and provides a different interfaceâ€¨
L Factory => Encapsulates object creation by providing an interface for creating an object without revealing the object's actual class
M Singleton => Ensures one and only one object is created
